# gridscale Builder

Type: `gridscale`

The `gridscale` Packer builder is able to create new images for use with
[gridscale](https://gridscale.io). The builder takes a source image,
runs any provisioning necessary on the image after launching it, then snapshots
it into a reusable image. This reusable image can then be used as the
foundation of new servers that are launched within gridscale.

The builder does _not_ manage images. Once it creates an image, it is up to you
to use it or delete it.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. They are
segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within
each category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.

### Communicator Config

In addition to the builder options, a
[communicator](/docs/templates/communicator) can be configured for this builder.

@include 'helper/communicator/Config-not-required.mdx'

@include 'helper/communicator/SSH-not-required.mdx'

@include 'helper/communicator/SSH-Private-Key-File-not-required.mdx'

### Required:

- `api_token` (string) - The client TOKEN to use to access your account. It
  can also be specified via environment variable `GRIDSCALE_TOKEN`, if
  set.

- `api_key` (string) - The client KEY (UUID) to use to access your account. It
  can also be specified via environment variable `GRIDSCALE_UUID`, if
  set.

- `server_cores` (int) - Number of server cores.

- `server_memory` (int) - Server memory capacity (in GB).

- `storage_capacity` (int) - Server's storage capacity (in GB).

### Optional:

- `api_url` (string) - The server URL to use to access your account.
  Default: "https://api.gridscale.io".

- `api_request_headers` (string) - Custom HTTP request headers.
  It is used for debugging purposes. Format: "key1:val1,key2:val2"

- `base_template_uuid` (string) - A pre-built template UUID.
  This template is used as a root template to produce another template.
  Note: one of these fields has to be set: isoimage_uuid, isoimage_url, base_template_uuid.

- `ssh_username` (string) - Username to access the server via SSH. (default: "root")

- `ssh_password` (string) - Password to access the server via SSH.
  Note: When `base_template_uuid` is used, `ssh_password` is required.

- `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key file to use to authenticate with SSH.
  The `~` can be used in path and will be expanded to the home directory
  of current user.

- `template_name` (string) - Name of the output template.

- `hostname` (string) - Name of the host.

- `server_name` (string) - Name of the server.

- `secondary_storage` (boolean) - SecondaryStorage is set to true when
  the server needs a secondary storage during producing template process.

- `isoimage_uuid` (string) - A pre-built iso-image is used by the given
  ISO-image UUID. If isoimage_uuid is set, isoimage_url is ignored.
  Note: one of these fields has to be set: isoimage_uuid, isoimage_url, base_template_uuid.

- `isoimage_url` (string) - An URL is used to download an ISO-image.
  If isoimage_uuid is set, isoimage_url is ignored.
  Note: one of these fields has to be set: isoimage_uuid, isoimage_url, base_template_uuid.

- `boot_command` (list) - This is an array of commands to type when the server instance is first
  booted. The goal of these commands should be to type just enough to
  initialize the operating system installer. Special keys can be typed as
  well, and are covered in the section below on the boot command. If this
  is not specified, it is assumed the installer will start itself.

- `boot_wait` (string) - The time to wait after booting the initial virtual machine before typing
  the `boot_command`. The value of this should be a duration. Examples are
  `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause Packer to wait five seconds and one
  minute 30 seconds, respectively. If this isn't specified, the default is
  `10s` or 10 seconds. To set boot_wait to 0s, use a negative number, such
  as "-1s"

 - `boot_key_interval` (string) - Time in ms to wait between each key press

## Basic Example

Here is a basic example. It is completely valid as soon as you enter your own
access tokens:

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "api_token": "xxxxxxxxxxx",
    "api_key": "xxxxxxxxxxx",
    "ssh_password": "examplePassword",
    "hostname": "ubuntu-host",
    "server_cores": "2",
    "server_memory": "4",
    "storage_capacity": "10",
    "secondary_storage": "true",
    "base_template_uuid": "4db64bfc-9fb2-4976-80b5-94ff43b1233a",
    "isoimage_uuid": "",
    "isoimage_url": "",
    "ssh_wait_timeout": "120s"
  },
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "gridscale",
      "api_token": "{{user `api_token`}}",
      "api_key": "{{user `api_key`}}",
      "ssh_password": "{{user `ssh_password`}}",
      "hostname": "{{user `hostname`}}",
      "ssh_username": "root",
      "server_memory": "{{user `server_memory`}}",
      "server_cores": "{{user `server_cores`}}",
      "storage_capacity": "{{user `storage_capacity`}}",
      "secondary_storage": "{{user `secondary_storage`}}",
      "base_template_uuid": "{{user `base_template_uuid`}}",
      "template_name": "{{user `template_name`}}",
      "server_name": "{{user `server_name`}}",
      "isoimage_uuid": "{{user `isoimage_uuid`}}",
      "isoimage_url": "{{user `isoimage_url`}}"
    }
  ]
}
```
